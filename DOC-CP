DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS – COMPLETE PREPARATION SHEET
TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY
Introduction

Time Complexity = number of operations
Space Complexity = extra memory used

We don’t measure seconds. We measure growth.

Growth Order (Best → Worst)

O(1) – Constant
O(log n) – Logarithmic
O(n) – Linear
O(n log n) – Log Linear
O(n²) – Quadratic
O(2ⁿ) – Exponential
O(n!) – Factorial

Asymptotic Notations

Big O → Upper Bound (Worst Case)
Omega → Lower Bound (Best Case)
Theta → Tight Bound (Average)

Analogy

Big O → At most
Omega → At least
Theta → Usually

Constant Time Example
if(i==100) break;


O(1)

Linear
for(i=0;i<n;i++)


O(n)

Quadratic
for(i)
 for(j)


O(n²)

Logarithmic (Binary Search)

O(log n)

Space Complexity

Constant:

int sum


Linear:

new array


Tradeoff: Speed vs Memory.
