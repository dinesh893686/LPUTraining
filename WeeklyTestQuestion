Machine Coding Round
Smart System Load Analyzer

Time Limit: 1 Hour
Allowed Languages: C++ / Java / Python

📌 Problem Statement

A data center records CPU load values (integers) at regular time intervals.
You are asked to analyze this sequence to derive meaningful insights about system behavior and stability.

🔢 Input Description

You are given:

An integer N — the number of recorded load values

A sequence of integers load[] of length N

An integer K — a positive integer

An integer T — a threshold value

An integer D — a positive integer

🎯 Required Output

You must compute and output three results, in the order described below.

Result 1

Consider all possible consecutive segments of the input sequence having length K.
For each such segment, determine a single representative value equal to the highest load observed within that segment.

Output these representative values in the order in which the segments appear.

Result 2

For each position in the input sequence, identify the nearest earlier position where the recorded load is strictly greater than the load at the current position.

If no such position exists, output -1 for that index.

Result 3

Using the sequence obtained in Result 1, determine the earliest position from which there exist at least D consecutive values that do not exceed the threshold T.

If no such position exists, output -1.

1 ≤ D ≤ N

⭐ Bonus Section (Optional)

Ensure the solution remains efficient for large input sizes

Explain how the analysis would adapt if load values arrive continuously over time

Extend the design to support changing values of K without reprocessing the entire input
