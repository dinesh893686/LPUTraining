Machine Coding Round
Smart System Load Analyzer

Time Limit: 1 Hour
Allowed Languages: C++ / Java / Python

📌 Problem Statement

A data center continuously records CPU load values (integers) at fixed time intervals.
You are asked to build a load analysis module that helps engineers understand system stress, historical dominance, and stability behavior.

Given a sequence of recorded load values and a few configuration parameters, your task is to analyze the data and report multiple observations.

🔢 Input Description

You are given:

An integer N — number of recorded load values

A sequence of integers load[] of length N

An integer K — segment length

An integer T — reference load limit

An integer D — required length of continuous stability

🎯 What Your Program Must Do

Your program must analyze the input and produce four outputs, each derived from the same input data and previous observations.

1️⃣ Segment Load Summary

The recorded data is divided into all possible consecutive segments of length K.

For each segment, compute a single value representing the highest load observed during that segment.

These values must be reported in the order in which the segments occur.

2️⃣ Historical Load Dominance

For every time position in the input sequence, determine whether there exists an earlier time position with a strictly higher load.

If such a position exists, report the closest earlier index where this happens.
If it does not exist, report -1.

3️⃣ Stable Operating Period Detection

Using the segment summary obtained earlier, determine the earliest segment position from which the system can operate continuously within acceptable limits.

A segment is considered acceptable if its summarized value does not exceed the given reference limit T.

Report the earliest position from which at least D such acceptable segments occur consecutively.
If no such position exists, report -1.

4️⃣ Minimum Required Load Tolerance

In some cases, the acceptable load limit is not known beforehand.

Using the same segment summary, determine the smallest possible load limit for which the system can operate acceptably for at least D consecutive segments.

Report this minimum required load limit.
